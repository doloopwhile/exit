OK	0	Successful program completion.
Failure	1	Unsuccessful program completion in a general sense.
Usage	64	The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
DataErr	65	The input data was incorrect in some way. This should only be used for user's data and not system files.
NoInput	66	An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not readable. This could also include errors like "No message" to a mailer (if it cared to catch it).
NoUser	67	The user specified did not exist. This might be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
NoHost	68	The host specified did not exist. This is used in mail addresses or network requests.
Unavailable	69	A service is unavailable. This can occur if a support program or file does not exist. This can also be used as a catchall message when something you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.
Software	70	An internal software error has been detected. This should be limited to non-operating system related errors as possible.
OSErr	71	An operating system error has been detected. This is intended to be used for such things as "cannot fork", "cannot create pipe", or the like. It includes things like getuid returning a user that does not exist in the passwd file.
OSFile	72	Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /var/run/utmp, etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
CantCreat	73	A (user specified) output file cannot be created.
IOErr	74	An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
TempFail	75	Temporary failure, indicating something that is not really an error. In sendmail, this means that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection, and the request should be reattempted later.
Protocol	76	The remote system returned something that was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
NoPerm	77	You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation. This is not intended for file system problems, which should use EX_NOINPUT or EX_CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.
Config	78	Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.
